  job_title: Summer Research Intern
  description: |
  I got an opportunity to work under Dr. Soumya K. Ghosh at IIT, Kharagpur as a Summer Research Intern. 
  Here, I got a significant understanding of data analysis and the application of graph theory on large datasets.
  I devised an algorithm for presenting an effective and optimal route in case of disruption of one or more stoppages
  in an existing bus route of a city. In this case the concerned dataset was the road network of the city of Kolkata, India and it's 
  public bus routes.
