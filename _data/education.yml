    During my degree at Bristol University I learnt lots of key skills such as team work and project management. Although
    we mainly focused on software development and the principles of programming I use a lot of these skills to
    my advantage in my day to day work.

    While at Bristol Uni I spent a lot of my free time with the Kitesurfing society. I spent 3 years on the committee
    as a secretary, trip rep and then media and promotions manager. During this time I took on roles from organising
    transport and designing posters to organising a trip to Portugal for over 30 students.
