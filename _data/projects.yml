    I'm currently developing an interactive interface to help users refine causal models by adding data found on the web, to overcome the problem of incomplete data with limited scope. Causal analysis is a powerful machine learning tool to derive knowledge about the world from data. But deriving exact causal relations between two variables is a difficult task due to the possible incompleteness of the data and the context. The addition of a new variable is capable of changing the way people might interpret the data. Our goal is to come up with a web application that provides the users with an interface to incorporate such user-defined additions/changes to the dataset such that the final result makes more sense in terms of real-world data.

    The model uses the easily available accelerometer data from the individualâ€™s cell phone to detect the occurance of heavy drinking episodes. Preprocessing the time series data by feature extraction to make it usable for classification is one of the major tasks in this implementation. I performed binary classification on time series data obtained from individual's mobile device to predict if it corresponds to an intoxicated participant using TAC levels and achieved a test accuracy of 77.5% using a random forest classifier.
