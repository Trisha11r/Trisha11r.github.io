    I'm currently developing an interactive interface to help users refine causal models by adding data found on the web, to overcome the problem of incomplete data with limited scope. Causal analysis is a powerful machine learning tool to derive knowledge about the world from data. But deriving exact causal relations between two variables is a difficult task due to the possible incompleteness of the data and the context. The addition of a new variable is capable of changing the way people might interpret the data. Our goal is to come up with a web application that provides the users with an interface to incorporate such user-defined additions/changes to the dataset such that the final result makes more sense in terms of real-world data.

    The model built uses the easily available accelerometer data from an individual’s cell phone to detect the occurance of heavy drinking episodes. Preprocessing the time series data by feature extraction to make it usable for classification is one of the major tasks in this implementation. I performed binary classification on time series data obtained from individual's mobile device to predict if it corresponds to an intoxicated participant using TAC levels and achieved a test accuracy of 77.5% using a random forest classifier.

    Visualized the most recently inspected and graded restaurants located in the five boroughs of New York City to provide the user with an interactive interface giving an insight into the hygienic conditions of the eateries of NYC. Used Unity and Vuforia to visualize data in the Augmented Reality space of the user. Vuforia uses computer vision to detect a plane in the physical space of the user, and objects can be placed in this detected plane. As a result, the orientation and positions of the objects change with the user's physical movement, as if they are actual physical objects placed near the user. Visualisations include a 3D Map of NYC depicted with restaurants and plots(line and bar plots along with brushing and linking feature).
