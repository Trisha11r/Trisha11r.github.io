  Replication of the model presented in the research paper (hKillian, J. A., Passino, K. M., Nandi, A., Madden, D. R., & Clapp, J. Learning to Detect Heavy Drinking Episodes Using Smartphone Accelerometer Data). 
  The model uses the easily available accelerometer data from the individualâ€™s cell phone

    The API for this site has been build using <mark>Symfony</mark> while the front end is a <mark>React</mark>/<mark>Redux</mark> app.
    I have used <mark>Docker</mark> to set up a development environment and <mark>Heroku</mark> to deploy and host the site. I have
    a suite of unit and API tests for the backend and unit tests for the front end.

    I have been using this project as a way to increase many of my skills and also learn new things. I have particually
    enjoyed managing my own project and designing my own architecture and implementing this to a high standard.

    Feel free to check out the whole project on GitHub to get a feel for how I work [here](https://github.com/sproogen/itsgoingto.be).

#     Forecastr is an android app designed to make it easy to view the forecast at your favourite spots. Targeted at
#     sports where the weather is key to a good session forecastr makes it quick to see which spot is best all
#     on one screen. Forecastr includes wind, weather, swell and tide times.

#     Forecastr is an app I have been building as I have a keen interest in
#     <mark>Android</mark> development and wanted a personal project I could use to help build my skills. I chose to build
#     this app as I felt like it's something I would use myself and also something that would set some good challenges
#     across lots of different areas of the build.

#     During the build I have utilised a number of different android libraries such as ActionBarSherlock, Dagger and
#     Otto. As well as these the app also talks to a backend API and uses a SQLite DB.
