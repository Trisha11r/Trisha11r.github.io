    Developing an interactive interface to help users refine causal models by adding data found on the web, to overcome the problem of incomplete data with limited scope. Causal analysis is a powerful machine learning tool to derive knowledge about the world from data. A problem is that many causal links offer only simplified explanations of the true relationships. The reason is incomplete data with limited scope. For e. g., does high ‘income’ really cause high ‘SAT’ scores; likely there are unknown relations inbetween. This project seeks to develop an interactive game-like interface by which users can refine causal models using data found on the web.
